CS230 Project: Deep Learning for PDE



## Description of the Project

Deep learning has been successful in many applications. This project tries to apply deep learning techniques to the numerial PDEs. Specificly, we focus on the Laplace problem

$$\Delta u(x,y)=f(x,y)$$

with Dirichlet boundary condition

$$u(x,y) = g_D(x,y)$$

Two dimensions and higher are tested and analyzed.
